              <p>
                BiteBit was born out of my personal struggle with calorie tracking. Traditional apps required 
                tedious manual input and often provided inaccurate nutritional information. I envisioned a 
                solution that could instantly analyze food portions and provide precise calorie counts using 
                AI-powered computer vision. BiteBit transforms the way people track their nutrition by simply 
                taking a photo of their meal, making healthy eating accessible and effortless for everyone.
              </p>

            <AccordionCard title="Technical Implementation">
              <p>
                BiteBit leverages cutting-edge technology to deliver accurate food analysis. The backend is 
                built with <strong>FastAPI</strong> for high-performance API endpoints, integrated with 
                <strong>YOLOv8</strong> for real-time object detection to identify food items. 
                <strong>MiDaS depth estimation</strong> calculates portion sizes from 2D images, while our 
                custom-trained models provide nutritional analysis. The frontend uses <strong>React/Next.js</strong> 
                for a seamless user experience, with the entire system deployed on cloud infrastructure 
                for scalability and reliability.

            <AccordionCard title="Impact">
              <p>
                BiteBit has gained significant early traction with over <strong>2,000+ early users</strong> 
                actively testing the platform. Our growth strategy includes targeted influencer marketing 
                campaigns and viral content on <strong>TikTok and Instagram</strong>, showcasing the app's 
                ease of use and accuracy. The positive user feedback and organic growth demonstrate the 
                strong market demand for AI-powered nutrition tracking solutions.
